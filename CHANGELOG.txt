----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.0 (for POE 2.4/atlas)
----------------------------------
Thank you for the energy!!!

WORD OF WARNING: If for some reason the filter will not work at the start, I'll fix the mistakes within the first 5 minutes, just check the github again in a few minutes.

Filterversions:

- Regular - displays all rares
- Semi-Strict - hides all "*/bad rares" in the endgame and also all "clunky/ok" rares. Also hides clunky chromatic recipes, non 83/84 crafting items and is recommended for small parties and experienced players
- Strict - hides all non-good and even the good/2h items that are not top-tier. Recommended for large parties and heavy magic find characters. NOT recommended for beginners.
- Slick - same as regular, however less colors.

You can get more information and the filter itself: https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1246208

Or you can get the filter directely from my GITHUB: https://github.com/

If you want the notepad++ highlighting you can also find it on GITHUB

CHANGELOG:
----------------------------------

**ATLAS MATERIAL ADDED TO FILTER:**

- Reworked the map section. It's now DropLevel based and split into T15/16
- Added essences, remnants, sextant's... (all new Atlas items, details below)
- Added new bases to the crafting, rare and 84+ sections, they have a organish border
- Added new divination cards (the void card temp. has a purple border)
- Added Shaper Orb's to the questitems
- Added essences! T1-T5 essences have a blue background, T6 the same background as Stacked Decks and T7 the same as exalted orbs
- Added Master Cartographer's and "corrupted essences" to teh stacked deck section.
- Possibly other things I forgot, but did it anyway ._.

**STRUCTURE:**

- Cleaned up and sorted all entries in the filter using a .NET tool.
- Changed the structure of several sections.
- Reworked all itemsizes. Priority pickups are all a tiny big larger
now, while all other items are smaller
- Revamped the rare section. Removed the simple 69+ base items evaluation and added T1/T2 rares instead with slightly stronger highlight (same color, but more opacity/size)
- Revamped the divination cards a tiny bit

**CURRENCY:**

- All currency items now have a background. The background is very subliminal for low currency and only noticable (and looks good) in groups

**RARES:**

- Rare rings, amulets, jewels and belts have a slightly strong green
background

**CRAFTING:**

- Added the new base items! Since they're novelty and usually quite
powerful, they'll be generally visible, no matter the rarity. 83/84
versions of those items will receive a special highlighting.
- Itemlevel 83/84 crafting list now has 2 tiers. The most popular
crafting bases have a stronger yellow border ( BaseType "Onyx Amulet"
"Diamond" "Prismatic" "Titanium Spirit Shield" "Hubris Circlet"
"Sorcerer Boots" "Sorcerer Gloves" "Vaal Regalia" ).
- Added heretics veil to the Chance item list

**SOUNDS:**

- Changed the dropsounds for Chaos Orbs and similar Dropsound item from 1 -> 2
- Added a dropsound for "random uniques". Only the good ones will have the same sound as exalted/divines now

**LEVELLING:**

- Reworked ALL levelling sections
- During the first 12 levels, where you still pick up/sell white items
for wisdoms, clunky normal rarity items (and shields/body armours that
slow you down) are less white and more grey.
- Changed the highlighting for rare gloves, boots, helmets and caster
items while levelling.
- Added extra highlighting for coral rings, leather belts and saphire
rings during the first 12 levels.
- Added a special section where you can easily define and disable
certain item classes while levelling. e.G. you only want to see bows of
all weapons.
- Made the levelling section work better in the essence league (special highlighting/evaluation for good weapon bases)

**MAP FRAGMENTS:**

- Lower values fragments are now red-text/border with a black background
- Higher value fragments are now balck-text/border with a red background
- Top tier fragments still have white backgrounds.
- The 4 compass rose fragments are classified as top tier in the filter

**SPECIAL:**

- Improved the failsafe that prevents absolutely new item classes from
getting hidden
- Added special tags throughout the filter for easier search and for the
FilterBlade project.
- Added some disabled optional sections: ranged animated weapons,
identified magic animated weapons, identified ranged magic animated
weapons
- Made jewel drops super pretty
- Thank you for all your energy \o/!!!
- There's likely more changes I forgot, this version really changed the majority of all sections, but I hope you guys like the outcome!
